# SolePatrol-Android-App
Sole Patrol was created by a team of 4 developers as part of our Digital Transformation module at Queen's University Belfast. It is a android application with a Spring Boot back-end. It is a data-driven ‘safe walking’ navigation tool that not only helps people walk to their desired destination the quickest, but also is mindful of safety by taking into account local crime, street lighting and traffic data. Our product uses data analysis and manipulation of real time data to drive the algorithms that determine the safest route for our users. We use Google and PSNI API services to re-reroute users to avoid areas with high crime rates, low levels of foot traffic, or dark roads.
